      <li>I want to help stop World Hunger. I became passionate about this topic because of an amazing oppurtunity. I was chosen to partake in a program provided by my school. This program encouraged us to think of a problem and a solution and present on it. I had chosen to present on world hunger becasue I saw it as a big problem that we have to face world-wide.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The further I researched, the more I realized how important this topic is. I created this website to encourage and raise awareness to this issue. I created this website to help everyone who is suffering from hunger.  </li>
      <br>
      <li>I researched on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and saw that their second goal is Zero Hunger. If we can all contribute to this cause, then we may be able to achieve this goal.</li>
